# Pseudo Code
# initialize
# - set all as unexplored
# - set source node as explored, and push into queue
# - SHORTEST PATH, initialize distance(v), 0 if v ==s, infinity else
# while queue != 0
# 	- remove first node of queue, v
# 	for w, each edge in v 
# 		- if w is not explored
# 			 - set as explored
# 			 - push into queue
			 # - SHORTEST PATH, set distance(w) dist(v) + 1
			 # at end dist(v) = ith layer
