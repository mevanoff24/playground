sample space - all possible outcomes
						 - probability of >= 0
						 - example rolling 2 dice = 1/36 chance, quicksort = choosing pivot
event - subset of everthing that couold happen
      - subset of sample space
      - add up all to get probability
      - example sum of dice is 7 = 1/6, quicksort = 25/75 split 1/2
random variable - real valued function
  						  - gives back a number
  						  - exampe sum of 2 dice = between 2 and 12
  						  - expectation - average value of sum 
Linearity of Expectation - If you want to think of expected value of sum of variables, it doesnt matter if you take sum first then expectation or vice versa, expectation * sum and sum * expectation will be same

Load Balancing Solution - assign random server to random number
					- sample space = all are equally likely
