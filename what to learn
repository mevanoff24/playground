Big-O
Sorting - quick and merge
Hashtable - with arrays
Trees - basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. You should be familiar with binary trees, n-ary trees, and trie-trees
Trees - red/black tree, a splay tree or an AVL tree
Trees - tree traversal algorithms: BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder
Graphs - objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list
Graphs - breadth-first search and depth-first search. computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code.
Other Data Types - traveling salesman and the knapsack problem
